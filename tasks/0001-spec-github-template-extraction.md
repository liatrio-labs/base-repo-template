# Specification: GitHub Template Repository Extraction

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This specification describes the creation of a GitHub template repository (`open-source-template`) derived from the `spec-driven-workflow` project. The template will preserve the opinionated developer experience, tooling, and CI/CD automation while removing product-specific functionality. This enables Liatrio teams to bootstrap new projects with battle-tested quality gates, automation, and documentation standards from day one.

The source repository (`spec-driven-workflow`) provides an AI-assisted spec-to-delivery workflow with robust developer tooling including placeholders for linting/formatting, comprehensive pre-commit hooks, semantic versioning automation, and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines. The template extraction will distill these capabilities into a reusable starting point.

The source repository is located at `~/Liatrio/repos/spec-driven-workflow`. Reference files in it as necessary.

## 2. Goals

1. **Extract reusable developer experience infrastructure** from `spec-driven-workflow` into a standalone GitHub template repository
2. **Maintain all quality gates and automation** (CI/CD, pre-commit hooks, semantic-release) while removing domain-specific code
3. **Provide clear, actionable documentation** for Liatrio teams to customize and deploy the template
4. **Enable immediate productivity** with language-agnostic workflow templates and quality automation ready to customize
5. **Preserve AI workflow integrations** (Claude, OpenCode GPT-5 Codex) with clear setup instructions

### FR-6: GitHub Template Configuration

1. Enable "Template repository" setting in GitHub
2. Provide generalized issue templates (bug report, feature request)
3. Provide generalized pull request template
4. Document required GitHub secrets in README (note: all are configured at org level):
   - `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (for Claude workflow)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY_FOR_OPENCODE` (for OpenCode workflow)
   - Octo STS (for semantic-release, configured at org level)

### FR-7: Repository Settings Automation

1. **Capture settings from `spec-driven-workflow` via `gh` CLI**:
   - Use `gh api` to fetch branch protection rules from source repository
   - Use `gh api` to fetch repository settings (issues, wikis, discussions, etc.)
   - Document current settings in `docs/development.md` as recommended configuration
2. **Provide automation script for applying settings**:
   - Create script/documentation for applying settings via `gh api` PATCH requests
   - Include commands to configure: `has_issues`, `has_wiki`, `has_discussions`, etc.
   - Include commands to apply branch protection rules
   - Script should be idempotent and safe to run multiple times
3. **Document manual configuration steps as fallback**:
   - Provide step-by-step instructions for applying settings via GitHub UI
   - Include screenshots or links to relevant GitHub documentation

### FR-8: Template Validation

1. Ensure `.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs successfully on initial repository state
2. Validate all workflow files have correct YAML syntax
3. Ensure all documentation links and references are valid
4. Verify GitHub template settings are properly configured
5. Verify CI workflow runs successfully with placeholder jobs

### FR-9: Licensing & Attribution

1. Maintain Apache 2.0 license
2. Include LICENSE file with copyright attribution to Liatrio
3. Document how to change license if needed in README

## 6. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Spec-driven workflow tooling**: Remove MCP server, prompt templates, and SDD-specific features
2. **Product-specific functionality**: No domain logic from `spec-driven-workflow`
3. **Codecov integration**: Removed per user requirement 8
4. **Interactive setup script**: Not included (basic README guidance only per requirement 6b)
5. **Multiple example project types**: Only minimal placeholder, no CLI/library/API examples (per requirement 7d)
6. **Language-specific tooling**: Template should be language-agnostic; users add their preferred tech stack
7. **External user documentation**: Tailored for Liatrio internal teams (per requirement 11a)

## 7. Design Considerations

### Repository Layout

```text
open-source-template/
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/
│   │   ├── ci.yml (placeholder workflow structure)
│   │   ├── release.yml
│   │   ├── claude.yml
│   │   └── opencode-gpt-5-codex.yml
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
│   │   ├── bug_report.yml
│   │   └── feature_request.yml
│   ├── pull_request_template.md
│   └── chainguard/
│       └── main-semantic-release.sts.yaml
├── docs/
│   └── development.md
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── CONTRIBUTING.md
```

**Note**: Users will add their own source code directories, test directories, and language-specific configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) based on their chosen technology stack.

### Configuration Approach

- Template provides workflow **structure** and **placeholders** rather than language-specific implementations
- Users customize CI/CD pipelines based on their chosen technology stack
- Pre-commit hooks configured with language-agnostic checks (YAML validation, markdown linting, commitlint)
- Language-specific hooks (linting, formatting, testing) added by users during customization

### Documentation Tone

- Concise, actionable instructions
- Assumes basic Git and software development knowledge (Liatrio internal teams)
- Links to external documentation (GitHub, semantic-release) for detailed concepts

## 8. Technical Considerations

### Core Dependencies

- **Version control**: Git
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Pre-commit framework**: For enforcing quality gates locally
- **Semantic release**: For automated versioning and changelog generation

### Semantic Release Configuration

- Must be configured for GitHub releases
- Uses Octo STS for authentication (configured at Liatrio org level)
- Template starts at version `v0.1.0` with guidance for users to reset versioning
- Language-specific build/release steps added by users during customization

### Pre-commit Hook Flexibility

- `no-commit-to-branch` hook should be configurable (enabled via local config, not enforced by default)
- Document how to enable/disable in CONTRIBUTING.md

### AI Workflow Integration

- Claude and OpenCode workflows require repository secrets
- Should include clear documentation on obtaining and configuring secrets
- Workflows should gracefully handle missing secrets (fail with helpful error messages)

### Repository Settings Automation with `gh` CLI

- Use `gh api` GraphQL and REST endpoints to query and apply repository settings
- Branch protection rules can be fetched/applied via: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection`
- Repository settings (issues, wikis, etc.) can be updated via: `gh api -X PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo} -F has_issues=true -F has_wiki=true`
- Settings automation should be documented and optionally scripted for ease of use
- Placeholders `{owner}` and `{repo}` in API paths get auto-replaced with current repository values

## 9. Success Metrics

### Quality Success (Ongoing)

1. 🎯 All template-derived projects maintain green CI status
2. 🎯 Semantic-release successfully creates versions for template-derived projects
3. 🎯 Documentation questions account for <10% of template-related support issues
